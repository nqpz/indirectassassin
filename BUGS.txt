Bugs and missing features
=========================

Sound
-----

I couldn't get Haskell's SDL-mixer working. I tried on two different machines,
and both gave me a floating point exception when trying to play an .ogg Vorbis
file, though loading it seemed to be no problem. It is possible that it's my
system which has incompatible libraries.


Movement
--------

Not all movement is as fluid as it can be.


Speed
-----

Efficiency was not my goal with the 0.1.0 release, which should be obvious when
running my game on a not-too-new computer.


GameRunner.hs code cleanup
--------------------------

I consider it a bug that GameRunner.hs is so ugly. This is my first real
Haskell program, and I found Logic.hs more interesting.
