Bugs and missing features
=========================

These things will hopefully have been fixed in the next release.


Sound
-----

I couldn't get Haskell's SDL-mixer working. I tried on two different machines,
and both gave me a floating point exception when trying to play an .ogg Vorbis
file, though loading it seemed to be no problem. It is possible that it's my
system which has incompatible libraries. Once I get around to updating my
entire system, I'll report it if I still experience it.


Movement
--------

Not all movement is as fluid as it can be.


Speed
-----

Efficiency was not my goal with the 0.1.0 release, which should be obvious when
running my game on a not-too-new computer. Since the code needs to be
refactored anyway, making it more efficient could be done at the same time.


Code cleanup
------------

I consider it a bug that GameRunner.hs is so ugly. This is my first real
Haskell program, and I found Logic.hs more interesting to work on, meaning I
never got around to fixing GameRunner.hs. For one thing, there's a lot of code
duplication which is not nice. It would also be nice with some actual
commenting of code. There's also a lot of lines where length line > 80. My
separation of code into modules is also a bit arbitrary at times.
